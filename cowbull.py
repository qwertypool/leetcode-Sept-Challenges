# You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: 
#You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is.
# Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates
# how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls")
# and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows").
# Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

# Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows. 

# Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.

# Example 1:
# Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
# Output: "1A3B"
# Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.
